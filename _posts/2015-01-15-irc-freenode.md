I just discovered Freenode. It's an IRC server for general technology, mainly open source stuff, but has things like hardware and electronics (Arduino) also. Seems like a great place to gather latest information on the technology. *Also has a Minecraft channel and I like that a lot*  

I like it how everyone ask questions very freely, and other people try to answer them the best they can. I think this kind of atmosphere is very beneficial to developers and hackers. I smell a similar atmosphere as StackOverflow; Just a lot more casual.  

**To join:**  
The server host is `irc.freenode.net`. Just punch that into your IRC client and you should be connected.  
`/list` and you can list all the channels. There are many, so find however many you like.  


**Note:**   
Some channels require you to have a registered identity. You can do that easily by typing in the command

```irc
/msg NickServ REGISTER {password} {email}
```

Then a verification e-mail should be sent to you. Follow the instructions and you'll have a registered account.  
Channels like `##php`, `#python` and `#iphonedev` require registered accounts so I think it's worth it.  

I'm looking forward to reading and maybe participating on some channels throughout the following days.
