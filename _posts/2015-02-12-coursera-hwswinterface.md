So I finally finished my course on **Hardware/Software Interface** on Coursera!  

[https://class.coursera.org/hwswinterface-002](https://class.coursera.org/hwswinterface-002)

It was an awesome course, much more than I expected.  
It went into learning simple Assembly language, understanding different CPU architectures, the real difference between 32 and 64 bit word sizes, and even up to memory allocation.  

I got a good introductory knowledge about the real depths of programming, and it's pretty exciting.  

I just bought a book on Linux Kernels, so this knowledge should help me soldier through that book...
