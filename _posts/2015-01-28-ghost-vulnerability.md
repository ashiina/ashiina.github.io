So the GHOST vulnerability has been a hot topic. Articles like [this](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability) and [this](http://threatpost.com/ghost-glibc-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-affects-all-linux-systems/110679) discuss what it's about, and it's efffects, so I won't go into that.  

Reading further, I find that articles like [this](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/not-so-spooky-linux-ghost-vulnerability/?linkId=12013042) highlight the point that the danger of this vulnerability is limited. I am not sure if I just am not researching enough, but as far as I am seeing, there does not seem to be an actual remote exploitation taking place.  
Of course this does not mean that we don't have to patch up our `glibc`. That should be done immediately.   

It takes some work to remove each production server from the load balancer, patch & restart it, then attach it back on to the load balancer... this took me some time and effort. I wish there is a way to do this more easily. Maybe it calls for some automation.  

Oh well. Since we've seen Heartbleed, Shellshock, and POODLE already in this past year or two, I'm pretty sure we'll run ino more.  
And I think that is a good thing, because we all are benefiting from vulnerabilities being patched up every time.
