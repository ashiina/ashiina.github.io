I've been away from blogging for a while. Business has been prety hectic.  
As a CTO of a growing startup, I am facing the inevitable decrease of coding time, and an increase of management time.  
I have to proactively find time to code and try new things, otherwise my time gets filled up with non-technical matters more and more.  

There are things I want to do - going deeper into Python(Django) and Ruby(Rails), trying out new PHP frameworks, trying Cassandra, reading into widely used open source projects, etc...  

As a profession neck-deep into technology, I don't want to slow down my pace of learning new technologies. A challenge for my coming years...

Meanwhile, one thought I had which is worth noting here:
