This is my first post.  
I will be writing about code and technology in general.

I'm a co-founder/CTO of a startup based in Tokyo, Japan.
My interests in tech include:

* PHP
* DevOps
* AWS
* Mobile Application
* Security
* Agile/Scrum
* Business models

I've tried blogging a few times before but didn't work;  
Primarily because I worry too much about what readers think, and how to write "catchy" blogs.
Hope I don't have to worry about that kinda stuff this time.
